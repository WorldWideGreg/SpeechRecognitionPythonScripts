# SpeechRecognitionPythonScripts

SpeechRecog.py use the sound input for recording speech in the terminal directly. (consider adding the creation of a serialized or txt file).  

AssemblyAI is just a chain of script for manually asking for a transcript of a song.  
Used this way bescause i didnt had to full automatize the process (very large song files with hours of uploading).  
In order it's SendSong.py > AskingTranscript.py > GetTranscription.py > DeleteFileFromServer.py  

Enjoy
